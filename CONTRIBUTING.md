# Contribution Guidelines

Each of the files in here is written in Markdown, so you should be able to edit them using an text editor, and even in GitHub directly:

- [Edit the data/software page](https://github.com/IDEALLab/design-data-list/edit/master/README.md)
- [Edit the blogs page](https://github.com/IDEALLab/design-data-list/edit/master/blogs.md)
- [Edit the books page](https://github.com/IDEALLab/design-data-list/edit/master/books.md)

If you would like to contribute to any of these lists (please do), then just [initiate a pull-request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) and I'll accept it keeping in mind the following format:

- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- Organize your contribution into the following pages:
 - `README.md`: Main page for links to data sources for design applications. These can be: Links to GitHub (or non-GitHub) repos or Individual researchers/lab websites that have directions on them. This can include both raw data files as well as code libraries by the design research and computing community.
 - `blogs.md`: A running list of blogs related to design research or data-science that might be relevant.
 - `books.md`: A useful list of books or monographs that address the intersection of Design and Data. Could also cover things like applied statistics and experimental design.
- I recommend the following format for commit message to keep things easy to track: `Adding [data|blog|book] by <author> <year published> `. For example `Adding blog by Fuge 2015` or `Adding data by Campbell 2013`.
- After you add your contribution, make sure the list remains alphabetical (within each heading section).
