# Design Data List
<small>Attribution note: This repo was modeled after the [Awesome Machine Learning](https://github.com/josephmisiti/awesome-machine-learning) list, and follows a similar set of styles and guidelines.</small>

An evolving list of open-source or otherwise available datasets for various applications and papers within Mechanical Engineering as well as Design more broadly. If you want to [contribute](https://github.com/IDEALLab/design-data-list/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) to this list (please do), send me a pull request or [contact me](http://ideal.umd.edu/contact_faq.html).

This file lists data or software sources, but you might also be interested in Design and Data related [blogs](https://github.com/IDEALLab/design-data-list/blob/master/blogs.md) or [books](https://github.com/IDEALLab/design-data-list/blob/master/books.md).

# Research Group Repositories
Various different groups within the Design Research community maintain active repositories or resources pages where they occasionally add or update new data or code. We encourage you to check out their pages, since they might release something new before we have the opportunity to add it to here (if you do find something new, please consider [contributing](https://github.com/IDEALLab/design-data-list/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).)
